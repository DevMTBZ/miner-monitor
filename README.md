### Prerequisites

miner-monitor requires nodejs >= 7.6.0, npm and optionally pm2 to run.

for now you will need to remove the auth/session authorization in /var/www/f_status.php on all baikal miners you want to add.

miners require the agent to be installed (agent currently referrers to the miner-manager)

### Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/felixbrucker/miner-monitor
cd miner-monitor
npm install
npm install pm2 -g
```

### Run

```sh
pm2 start process.json
```

or

```sh
npm start
```

to startup on boot:

```sh
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

or just modify startTemplate.bat file to match your preferred compile and save as start.bat to not interfere with git updates

run ``` git pull ```
